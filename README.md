# Natural Gas Forecasting & Storage Contract Pricing

This project was completed as part of the **J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Virtual Experience** on Forage.

It combines time series forecasting and financial modeling to support pricing strategies for natural gas storage contracts using historical and seasonal price data.

---

## 🔍 Task 1: Natural Gas Price Forecasting

- **Visualized** monthly natural gas prices (Oct 2020 – Sep 2024)
- **Detected** seasonal trends using monthly averages
- **Forecasted** prices for the next 12 months
- **Built** a function to estimate the price of gas for any given date

---

## 💼 Task 2: Storage Contract Pricing Model

- **Developed** a reusable Python function to simulate gas injection, storage, and withdrawal
- **Calculated** net profit by factoring in:
  - Injection and withdrawal dates
  - Market prices
  - Storage duration and cost
- **Validated** model with test cases
- **Visualized** injection/withdrawal against historical prices and volume trends

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- Monthly gas prices with forecast overlay
- Injection and withdrawal events marked on price timeline
- Storage volume changes over time

---

## 📁 Files
- `JPMC_Project.ipynb`: Notebook with full implementation of Task 1 & 2
- `Nat_Gas.csv`: Dataset used for price analysis
